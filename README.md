# DWA-Data-Scraper
Scrape hydrological data from the South African department of Water and Sanitation for use in modeling.

The source of the data can be found at this address, http://www.dwa.gov.za/Hydrology/Verified/hymain.aspx

This project should first download the raw files from each of the stations and then convert them to CSVs for easier use.
